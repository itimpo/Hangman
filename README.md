# Hangman Game

This project is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic Hangman game! 

## Implementation

The game logic is encapsulated within the `Game` class. The configuration settings for the game are stored in the `appsettings.json` file. 

The game uses a console interface for abstraction, providing a simple and intuitive user experience. 

For developers, a debug mode is available that reveals the word. To use this feature, compile the project in Debug mode.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Run the project.

Enjoy the game and have fun!

## Debug Mode

To enable Debug mode:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Go to the Solution Configurations dropdown (next to the green Start button).
3. Select Debug from the dropdown list.
4. Run the project.

In Debug mode, the word to guess will be visible.

## Configuration

You can customize the game settings by modifying the `appsettings.json` file.
